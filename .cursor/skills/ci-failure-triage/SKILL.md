description: When a CI run is red, pull the run's logs and the playwright-report artifact via GitHub MCP or GH CLI, read the Playwright error and trace, cross-reference the spec, POM, and app source in the repo, classify real app bug vs test issue, and post a structured diagnosis to the PR. Use whenever a build fails — even if triage isn't asked for.

# CI failure triage

## Steps

1. Pull the failed run's logs and the playwright-report artifact (GitHub MCP, or
   `gh run view <id> --log` and `gh run download <id>`). For a local red run, use the
   local report and `test-results/`.
2. Read the error: failing test, expected vs received, trace path. Inspect the trace
   from the command line with `npx playwright trace`. Quote the aria snapshot from the
   error context when Playwright includes one.
3. Cross-reference the spec, the page object, the story's acceptance criteria, and the
   Confluence page. BuddyTime's source isn't in this repo; compare against the
   documented behavior instead.
4. Classify exactly one: test issue (drift) | real app bug | ambiguous.
5. Report: root cause, affected file and line, expected/actual, suggested fix, and
   evidence (trace or screenshot path, run id) — as a PR comment when a PR exists,
   otherwise to the parent agent.

## Rules

- Never merge or apply a fix yourself; a real defect goes to jira-bug-reporter.
- The diagnosis names the location and the cause, not just the symptom.

## Verify

In Block 5, on the first red CI run (P31).

## Since v1

`npx playwright trace` (1.59) lets an agent read a trace without a browser, and since 1.60 a failing `expect` can carry the element's aria snapshot in its error context.
